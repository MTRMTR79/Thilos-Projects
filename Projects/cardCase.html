                        This card case is designed to keep cards safe from the monster that is my backpack. I am proud of this project as it is the first project where I used my logo, and a design that is entirely mine, to solve a problem.

                        I often bring a deck of cards with me, on holidays or even just day to day, but the tuck box (cardboard box) will often rip or fall apart within a few trips.

                        I designed the box in CAD, by measuring the cards, then drawing it out. I added my logo on top, and a hole on the bottom so you can easily push the cards out.

                        First try I got the size correct for the cards to fit, measure twice cut (or print) once! Although, the hole in the bottom was a bit small for my finger.

                        I had a different size of cards, so I changed the sizes, but I forgot to change the size of the slot, so the lid didn't fit. One more try later and it worked, but the hole was still small.

                        For this version I made the hole bigger, and it worked perfectly!. It turns out that most other decks I have are that size, so I made a few more in some different colours.
