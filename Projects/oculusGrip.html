                        This is a asthetic addition for oculus controlers that I designed. It is designed to be 3D printed, and went through multiple revisions.

                        I saw lots of pictures of gun grips online, about the time I was really getting into a shooter (Zombieland VR: Headshot Fever). I really liked this idea, but I thought it was rediculus to buy one for $30. So I decided to make one.

                        My first try I made it WAYYYYY to big, yet I didn't account for the change in diamiter of the handle, so it didnt fit. I also realised I needed supports for the print, desperately.

                        On the second try it fit! Well enough that I realised I don't need another part to lock it in. On the other hand, the handle was still too big,and I realised I didn't love the look of it.

                        I fixed up the look of it, and I think it looks a lot nicer, but I accidentally took a chunk out of it. And I reduced the handle diameter but it was too short. I also added the quote from the game/movie #2 Double Tap.

                        For this version I extented the handle, so now it is comfortable to hold, and fixed the hole. There are a few more touches that could be added, and it could do with a paint job, but this is the end of the project for now :)
